#Description:
We create two definitions, merching the two previous created files into one file. 
We combine the toponyms, lon and lat with the TGN-numbers. The first entry is the frequency and the second the TGN number. 
Then we create a dictionary out of the two files and load it into a new file called tgn_data_light.
