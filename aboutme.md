Hello internet! read too much information about me:

- Aramboa is the alias of Vienna-based producer Moritz Ren√© Scharf. Being involved in music since his early childhood coming from a jazz background on guitar, he started producing and performing electronic music quickly. After a first release experimenting on the edge of electronica/downtempo, shaped by lively collaborations, especially with singer Elena Shirin, international festival appearances in Europe, the U.S. and South-Africa followed. Now he is off for presenting his latest studio-works where dreamy/artificial soundscapes and a catchy live brass-section collide into a beatdriven euphoric dancefloor experience. 

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
